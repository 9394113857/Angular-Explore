# Step 1: Remove the existing Git repository
# This command deletes the .git folder, which contains the Git history and configuration for the project.
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git

# Step 2: Reinitialize the Git repository
# After deleting the .git folder, initialize a fresh Git repository in your project directory.
git init

# Step 3: Add all files to the repository
# This command stages all files in the project directory, preparing them to be committed.
git add .

# Step 4: Commit the files to Git
# The 'git commit' command creates the first commit in your newly initialized repository.
# The -m flag allows you to provide a commit message; here, we use "Initial commit".
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Step 5: Set up the remote repository (optional)
# If you want to push your local repository to a remote server (e.g., GitHub or GitLab),
# you must set the remote URL. Replace <your-remote-url> with the actual URL of your remote repository.
git remote add origin <your-remote-url>

# Step 6: Push the commit to the remote repository (optional)
# This command pushes the initial commit to the remote repository you added earlier.
# Use "master" or "main" based on your default branch name.
git push -u origin master  # Use 'main' if that's your default branch name
