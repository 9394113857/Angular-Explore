Here’s a merged, concise explanation based on your latest context:

1.	First time running ng s: Angular asks if you want to share usage data (analytics) with the Angular team.
2.	Subsequent times running ng s: It doesn't ask again since your choice (Yes/No) is saved locally and globally.
3.	Backend Process: Each time you run ng s, Angular:
o	Compiles the application (ng build behind the scenes).
o	Bundles files like main.js, styles.css, polyfills.js, and runtime.js.
o	Starts the Angular Live Development Server to serve your app at http://localhost:4200/.
4.	Analytics Settings:
o	Your preference for data sharing is saved and won’t be prompted again unless changed.
o	You can modify analytics settings later using ng analytics enable or ng analytics disable.
5.	Build Output: Angular displays compiled file sizes, build hash, and the time it took to generate the bundles, which gives you performance metrics.

In short, the process stays the same after the first time: Angular serves the app while keeping your analytics setting intact and not prompting again.
